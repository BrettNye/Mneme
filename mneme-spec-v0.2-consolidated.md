# Mneme Specification v0.2 (consolidated)

**Status:** Canonical. Folds and supersedes: Mneme v0.1 spec, v0.1.1 errata, v0.2 expansion (revised). Errata corrections are applied inline; capability additions integrated; erasure deferred (Appendix H).

**Tier legend:** [C] Core — every implementation MUST support. [P] Protocol extension — declared protocol, reference impl provided, opt-in. [Prof] Customer-gated profile — specified, not shipped.

**Implementation-neutral:** pseudocode notation; storage adapters named; no host language mandated (see §1.4, Appendix G).
